# Welcome to the Chimera Society Source repo!
This is the public repository for my roblox game [Chimera Society](https://www.roblox.com/games/106820629618215/Chimera-Society).
**You can find the repo for the lobby's code [here](https://github.com/Batteryhunter333/Chimera-Society-Lobby)!**

## ABOUT:

This repo contains all the scripts used in my Rojo project connected to the game's studio place, as well different branches for various development purposes. 
This repo is actively used for the development of the game, so if you find that kinda stuff interesting feel free to poke around!

> <sub>*Though, the game isn't out, so I have no idea why you'd be here right now...*</sub>

**Feel free to use this project as a reference for your own games!**
I want this to be a useful resource for any developers who might find value in any of this.
The code isn't perfect, but I'd like to imagine someone could find some of this to be helpful :)
